[SIZE="5"]About ProjectX[/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"]With ProjectX, the successor of CyanHacker, we are starting a project that aims to provide an awesome User Experience all over the place. Whilst most other ROMS try to provide as many features as possible, we want to develop a ROM which is clean, fast, well maintained, optimized and has some of the greatest, most useful cherry-picks. ProjectX is based on Cyanogenmod and packed with Optimizations and improvements on your experience.  [/SIZE] 
[SIZE="5"]Our goal: Provide the best Android experience avaiable![/SIZE]
